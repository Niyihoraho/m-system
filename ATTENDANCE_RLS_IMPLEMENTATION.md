# Attendance RLS Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented scope-based Row Level Security (RLS) for the attendance functionality, ensuring users can only access events and attendance records within their organizational scope.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes (`app/links/activities/attendance/page.tsx`)

#### Added User Scope Integration
- Imported and integrated `useUserScope` hook
- Added scope-based filtering for events and members
- Removed unnecessary scope filters for non-super admin users
- Added scope information display for regular users

#### Key Features
- **Super Admin**: Can see scope selector and all filter options
- **Regular Users**: See only their scope information and relevant data
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators while scope is being fetched
- **Scope Display**: Shows current user's scope and organizational context

#### Event Filtering
- Events are now filtered based on user's scope automatically
- Super admins can override scope filters manually
- Regular users only see events within their scope

#### Member Filtering
- Members are filtered based on user's scope
- Attendance records are scoped to user's organizational level

### 2. Backend API Changes

#### Events API (`app/api/events/route.ts`)
- Added RLS integration using `getUserScope()` and `getTableRLSConditions()`
- Events are filtered based on user's organizational scope
- Super admins can override scope filters with explicit parameters
- Access control for individual event retrieval

#### Attendance API (`app/api/attendance/route.ts`)
- Implemented RLS for attendance record retrieval
- Added scope-based filtering for member access
- RLS checks for attendance record creation
- Access control for both members and events in attendance records

### 3. RLS Implementation Details

#### Scope Levels
- **Super Admin**: Access to all data, can override scope filters
- **National**: Access to all regions (no filtering)
- **Region**: Access to specific region and all its children
- **University**: Access to specific university and its small groups
- **Small Group**: Access to specific small group only
- **Alumni Group**: Access to specific alumni group only

#### Security Features
- User authentication required for all endpoints
- Scope-based data filtering at database level
- Access control for individual records
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Users can only access data within their organizational scope
2. **Performance**: Reduced data transfer by filtering at API level
3. **User Experience**: Cleaner interface with relevant data only
4. **Compliance**: Proper data isolation based on organizational hierarchy
5. **Scalability**: Easy to extend for additional scope levels

## Testing

Created test script (`test-attendance-rls.js`) to verify:
- Events API returns scoped data
- Attendance API returns scoped records
- User scope endpoint works correctly
- RLS is properly enforced

## Usage

1. **Super Admin**: Can use scope selector to view data from any organizational level
2. **Regular Users**: Automatically see only data within their scope
3. **Event Selection**: Only shows events relevant to user's scope
4. **Member Access**: Only shows members within user's organizational scope
5. **Attendance Records**: Filtered by user's scope automatically

## Future Enhancements

- Add audit logging for scope-based access
- Implement role-based permissions within scopes
- Add bulk operations with scope validation
- Create scope-based reporting features
